AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers
==================================

**AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers** is a **collection of security middleware** that you can use in your **ASP.NET Core 1.0** application to support social authentication providers like **[GitHub](https://github.com/)**, **[Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/)** or **[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)**. It is directly inspired by **[Jerrie Pelser](https://github.com/jerriep)**'s initiative, **[Owin.Security.Providers](https://github.com/RockstarLabs/OwinOAuthProviders)**.

**The latest official release can be found on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/aspnet-contrib) and the nightly builds on [MyGet](https://www.myget.org/gallery/aspnet-contrib)**.

## Getting started

**Adding social authentication to your application is a breeze** and just requires a few lines in your `Startup` class:

    app.UseGitHubAuthentication(options => {
        options.ClientId = "49e302895d8b09ea5656";
        options.ClientSecret = "98f1bf028608901e9df91d64ee61536fe562064b";
    });

See [https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers/tree/dev/samples/Mvc.Client](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers/tree/dev/samples/Mvc.Client) for a complete sample **using ASP.NET Core MVC and supporting multiple social providers**.
