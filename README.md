AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers
==================================

__AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers__ is a __collection of security middleware__ that you can use in your __ASP.NET 5__ application to support social authentication providers like __[GitHub](https://github.com/)__, __[Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/)__ or __[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/)__. It is directly inspired by __[Jerrie Pelser](https://github.com/jerriep)__'s initiative, __[Owin.Security.Providers](https://github.com/RockstarLabs/OwinOAuthProviders)__.

__The latest nightly builds can be found here__: __[https://www.myget.org/F/aspnet-contrib/](https://www.myget.org/F/aspnet-contrib/)__

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3lh3pq6e57c8pnr4/branch/dev?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/aspnet-contrib/aspnet-security-oauth-providers/branch/dev)
[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers)

## Dependencies

The __dev__ branch relies on the latest version of __DNX__ and __ASP.NET 5__, that can be found on __MyGet__: __[https://www.myget.org/gallery/aspnetvnext](https://www.myget.org/gallery/aspnetvnext)__.

Make sure to always run the latest __DNX__ version and the corresponding __ASP.NET 5__ packages by running `dnvm upgrade -u` and `dnu restore`.

## Getting started

__Adding social authentication to your application is a breeze__ and just requires a few lines in your `Startup` class:

    app.UseGitHubAuthentication(options => {
        options.ClientId = "49e302895d8b09ea5656";
        options.ClientSecret = "98f1bf028608901e9df91d64ee61536fe562064b";
    });
