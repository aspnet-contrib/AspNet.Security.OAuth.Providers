# Contributing

## Feature requests and bugs

Please submit any feature requests or bugs as an [issue](https://github.com/aspnet-contrib/AspNet.Security.OAuth.Providers) in GitHub.

## New OAuth Providers

New OAuth providers are added by the community, not the maintainers.

If you wish to add a new provider that is not already part of this repository, fork the repository and try and implement it yourself.

Then you can submit it back as a Pull Request for inclusion here.

New providers are likely to be merged if they are based on OAuth 2.0
