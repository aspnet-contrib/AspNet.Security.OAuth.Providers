### Which provider would you like support added for?

<!--
The name of the OAuth 2.0 provider you'd like to support added for.
Providers that deviate significantly from the OAuth 2.0 specification
with non-standard extensions and/or behavior are unlikely to be accepted.
-->

### Provider Documentation

<!--
Any relevant links to the reference documentation for the OAuth 2.0 provider.
These links are preferably to the technical documentation that can be worked
from to implement the provider code with.
-->

### Are you willing to implement this provider yourself?

<!--
Are you willing to implement this provider yourself and contribute it to the
repository as a pull request?

If you are not able or willing to implement this provider yourself, the repository
maintainers are unlikely to be able to commit to implement it for you, especially
if the provider is not a product or service that the maintainers actively use
and/or have access to (for example, a paid-for enterprise service).

Providers that you are not able to implement yourself but would be valuable
to the open source community if they existed will be labelled with "help wanted".
Such issues will then be dependent on the community to implement at some point,
but do not represent any commitment from the maintainers to do so.

### Additional context

<!--
Add any other context about the new provider that may be relevant.
