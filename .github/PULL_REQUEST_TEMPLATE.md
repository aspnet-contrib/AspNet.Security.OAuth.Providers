<!--

Summarize the changes this Pull Request makes.

Please include a reference to a GitHub issue if appropriate.
It is not necessary to create a new issue just to open a Pull Request.

If adding a new provider, please ensure you have included appropriate test(s).

For new providers, a package with the same ID must not already exist in NuGet.org.
If it does, you must be the owner of the package and agree to transfer ownership
of the package to the [aspnet-contrib](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/aspnet-contrib)
organisation after the Pull Request is merged so we can take over publishing of
the provider from our Continuous Integration.
